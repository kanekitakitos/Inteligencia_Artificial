> This repository presents a collection of laboratory implementations of fundamental Artificial Intelligence algorithms, developed in Java, with a primary focus on heuristic methods and artificial neural networks implemented entirely from first principles.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a set of practical laboratory exercises designed to explore core concepts in Artificial Intelligence. Each laboratory addresses a specific topic, ranging from heuristic-based problem solving to the mathematical formulation and implementation of artificial neural networks, including Perceptrons and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

All algorithms are implemented *from scratch*, without the use of external machine learning or numerical computation frameworks, with the objective of providing a rigorous understanding of the underlying mathematical models and computational procedures.
